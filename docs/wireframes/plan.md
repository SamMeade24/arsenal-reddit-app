# Arsenal Reddit Comment Explorer - Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview
This project will be a web application that pulls Reddit discussions around Arsenal FC and presents it in a clean, engaging way. The goal is to demonstrate my growing ability to work with APIs, managing data, and building a user-focused interface that reflects both Arsenal FC's branding (where possible) and subtle personal influences with a MadeByMeade signature.

## 4. Tech Stack & Scope
This project will:
  - Utilise technologies and frameworks I've covered so far in the **Codecademy Full Stack Career Path**
  Grow as my learning and knowledge progresses

## 5. Going Above & Beyond
If time allows, I'd also like to try and include:
  - Additional filtering (e.g. latest, most upvoted)
  - Ability to select different Arsenal-related subreddit categories (e.g. transfer stories, squad updates)

## 7. Timeline
I'm planning to work on this:
  - During lunch breaks
  - Some evenings after wor
  - Progressing steadily rather than rushing
  - Focusing on learning properly, not just "getting it done"

Plan:
  - I'll look to complete the core MVP first
  - Then depending on timescale, I'll look to build out the optional extras in a hope to impress future employers/clients
